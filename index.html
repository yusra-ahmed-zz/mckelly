                            <p>Tim has a way with words and charmed Michelle on Tinder. Their first date was at Freehouse before walking to Whole Foods for dessert of Mochi. Michelle’s nickname has been “Mochi” ever since. After dating for almost a year, Michelle made the move from Uptown to live in the North Loop with Tim and his lovably grumpy shih apso, Lando. Upon moving in together, Michelle and Tim rescued their quirky little shih tzu, Opal.</p>
                            <p>When not trying new restaurants, Tim and Michelle can be found at the movies, at home watching reality TV shows, or studying the law. Tim is the cook in the relationship, specializing in Italian cuisine. A famous favorite is his baked ziti. On occasion, Michelle will make lefse for Tim. Tim originally intended to propose on a trip to Miami, but bumped up his timeframe by a whole two weeks just so he could brighten the mood on election night.

He has been dragged to dance competitions, played sous chef in Michelle’s “baking shows,” been paid 10 cents to be a Diet Coke runner, and been in numerous situations together with their quirky parents. There is no better brother than Mattie and Michelle is so lucky to have him!</p>

They met in the dorms and after they got to know each other were fast friends. From obsessively going over AIM conversations, sharing a creepy attic apartment together, finding ways to procrastinate on papers, to running through the streets of Uptown, no friend truly knows Michelle quite like Yusra. Although they are both dramatic sometimes, Michelle and Yusra have so much fun together. Michelle is so happy that she has Yusra in her life!</p>

                            <p>Jenna is one of Michelle’s oldest and dearest friends. The two of them have been through so much together. During the awkward teenage years, they embarrassed themselves so many times (rolling on the floor in front of Varsity… There’s someone doing “drugs” in the bathroom… just to name a few). The adult years have honestly been pretty awkward too. As much fun as Michelle and Jenna have together, they have also supported each other through a lot. Jenna is one of Michelle’s deepest confidantes. There is no friend quite like Jenna!</p>

                            <p>Rochelle  (affectionately known as Roch) and Michelle met in college. They quickly bonded over their dislike of awkward house parties even creating “the awkward corner.” Through the years, Roch has been such an amazing friend to Michelle. She is the best giver of advice and is always one to help Michelle navigate a situation. Some of the best times with Roch have been spending summers walking the lake, grabbing happy hour as a break from busy lives, and finally hosting parties of their own so no “awkward corner” is needed. Roch is such an amazing friend to have!</p>

From travelling to Italy (and getting stuck in the Rome airport) to just hanging out in yoga pants drinking wine at someone’s apartment, Reva and Michelle always have fun. Reva has become such a trusted friend that Michelle can tell anything to. Reva truly is such a special friend to have!</p>

Some of the best memories Michelle has are of late nights spent out dancing with Rima, throwing WOP parties at their apartment, watching Bollywood, and staying up in their apartment having late night chats. Throughout the years, Rima has always been there for Michelle. She is such a great friend to have!</p>

Always ready with coffee, a yoga mat, and a listening ear, Heather’s supported Tim through the ups, downs and in-betweens. With three simple words of advice (“Get Tindin’, yo”), Heather Maurer made this entire website possible.</p>

Whether scaring people at the Dead End Hayride or rolling noobs in Destiny 2, there are few people Tim would rather have at his side.</p>

Brandon loves to take advantage of Michelle’s gullibility and he and Tim have had a few laughs at her expense. He is such a jokester, always making people laugh. All jokes aside, Brandon is one of the closest people to Michelle and has become a good friend to Tim as well. They are both so lucky to have him in their lives!</p>
